descriptive and analytical observation of well-being variables in Italy and Spain
Economic Landscapes and Human Flourishing
This repository contains the data, code, and analysis conducted for the Master Thesis titled "Economic Landscapes and Human Flourishing" by Nadia Napolano. The thesis was submitted as part of the requirements for the Master Degree in Computational Social Science at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, during the academic year 2023-2024.

The thesis explores the intersection between economics and human well-being, with a specific focus on comparing the socio-economic dynamics of Italian and Spanish regions. It investigates how different economic and social variables influence regional well-being, analyzing data from 2008 to 2020.

Key areas of study include:

The correlation between economic indicators and well-being.
A comparison of socio-economic behaviors in Italian and Spanish regions.
Statistical analyses using methodologies such as Time-Series Cross-Sectional (TSCS) analysis.
Repository Structure
/data: Contains the dataset used in the analysis: dataoutput. The data was sourced from Eurostat, ISTAT (Italy), and INE (Spain), and then processed to ensure homogeneity.
/code: R scripts used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
/results: Outputs of the analysis including graphs, statistical summaries, and model results.
/docs: Supporting documentation including the full thesis in PDF format.
Key Files
dataoutput.xlxs: The main dataset used for analysis, covering various socio-economic variables from 2008 to 2020.
tfm.Rdm: The primary R script that contains the analysis and statistical modeling.
Methodology
The analysis employs several statistical techniques:

Descriptive Analysis: Overview of the socio-economic behavior of Spanish and Italian regions.
Time-Series Cross-Sectional Analysis: Methodology used to study complex phenomena by analyzing data that varies both over time and between different units (regions).
Fixed and Random Effects Models: Models used to interpret variability within panel data and control for unobserved heterogeneity.
Findings
The thesis confirms the 'Easterlin Paradox,' showing that beyond a certain point, increased income does not correlate with increased happiness. It also highlights the importance of employment in reducing school dropout rates and suggests that regional economic policies need to be more tailored to local contexts.

Usage
To replicate the analysis:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Nadian17/
Ensure that R and the necessary libraries are installed.
Run the analysis.R script to process the data and generate the results.
